#Industrial Vision Intelligence System
The following algorithm is a felxible and light weight solution for SMES that require Vision Intelligence systems for Quality Control and Quality Checks.
This algorithm can be trained according to the specific need of the industry and on the basis of hardware limitations.
This provides a easy to modify light weight solution for SMES that do not have top of the end hardware available with them.
The following model can be deployed on Raspberry Pi5 and Pi AI cam3 and the output siganls are to sent to a the PLC system that carried out the necessary actuations required for sorting the product.
